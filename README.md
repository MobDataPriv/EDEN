# EDEN
Welcome to EDEN, a Location Privacy Protection Mechanism based on a federated risk assessment FURIA.

You can :

- Apply a set of LPPMs with different configuations, namely: Promesse, Geoi thanks to accio project and Trilateration.
- Apply Existing Re-identification attacks, namely : POI-Attack, PIT-Attack and AP-Attack thanks to accio project. 
- Train and Test FURIA, a federated user re-identification attack. We provide an exemple on Privamov mobility dataset where multiple rounds are considered. We suppose a training round is done every night, after collecting the mobility data of the user during the day. 
- Apply EDEN: Considering three LPPMs : Geoi, Promesse and Trilateration with three configuration each.

# Apply LPPM 

Mobility data is formatted as follows:

multiple subtraces of mobility per user = multiple CSV files named <user_id_seq>.csv

CSV file format = Each line is a record of the mobility trace.

One record = [lattitude,longitude,timestamp]

Timestamp = Unix time POSIX.

# Run LPPM script and produce feature vectors for each LPPM

bash run_LPPMs-train-SERVER.sh [data] [level=15] [nameOutput] "1" [pathToSourceFiles]  [workingDirectory] [promesse-distance=200.meters] [geoi-epsilon=0.01] [trl-range=2]
 
NB: Install S2Geometry library for python as illustated in https://s2geometry.io/about/platforms

# Run Attacks script 

bash run_single_attacks.sh [pathToTrainData]  [pathToTestData] [xdays=15days] [datasetName] [lppmName]  [workdir] [pathToSourceFiles]
  
# Run FURIA 

We provide an example of Privamov Dataset in running FURIA. Thus, here is the link for preprocessed data (feature vectors of non-obfuscated and obfuscated data previously generated): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FGxqMLihNVD8rq7LCqg1UrnraUN_1cXS?usp=sharing

The notebook includes : 

1- Setting ( prepare Project inputs)

2- Data preprocessing (Uniforming features, verifying timestamps, Reducing and centering, Normalizing ID)

3- Generate DRk (Data Round "k") : prepare mobility data of each round (i.e., each day) per user.

4- Generate models (AFi)

5- Test Model AFi with DRi+1.

# Run EDEN 

One the experiment of FURIA is done (i.e., the federated models are generated), collect the testing result of predictions of each round in "ProjectName/Evaluation/<datasetName>/Predictions/" 

Concatenate the utility metric values to each Prediction with prepareUtility-perDay.py

Then, run: python  EDEN.py [pathToPredictions] [outputDirectory] [outputFile]
  
[outputDirectory] : contains, for each round, protected users against AF model of FURIA. 

[outputFile] : has the following columns 'Dataset','Lppm','Model','Round', 'Nb_user','Correct', 'Total','Accuracy'.
